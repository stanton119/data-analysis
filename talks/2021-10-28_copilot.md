## Thoughts

*   Would we use it
    *   Private code being shared
*   Would we trust the results
    *   Blindly?
    *   GPT-3 has its issues
    *   bad examples
        *   [GTP-3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/li2afr/gpt3_is_bloodthirsty_i_guess_full_convo_below_it/)
        *   [Copilot](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/qfzpes/github_copilot_the_technology_that_will_replace)

----
*   Based on a dataset of code
    *   Ethical concerns around whether that code has correct license for parsing
    *   Is that code of good quality
*   Stifile innovation?
    *   Learn to copy and paste
    *   New libraries built on new ideas, this slows that?
