# Reinforcement learning

*   Images -> actions = policy network
*   Sparse rewards
    *   When we get a reward after a long time of playing a game
    *   Hard to decide which actions promoted a good reward vs not useful actions
    *   Creating manual logic for smaller rewards can help but is very difficult to get right
    *   Model can learn how to overfit those smaller rewards
